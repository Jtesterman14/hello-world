# hello-world
getting started with GitHub

This is the introduction walk through I am going through to learn how to use GitHub and its cool features.
This seems like a great way to work on projects as a team since it seems like it allows you to make versions of
the project before committing it fully to the grand design. Hope to learn more and get proficent with this.
